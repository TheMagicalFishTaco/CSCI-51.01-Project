2. go to the folder where the file "Co_Sumingit_Tsai_Project_Main.cpp" is located. Open the terminal from that folder. Or, if you open the terminal elsewhere, navigate to the folder containing the file.
4. compile with "g++ -o [FileName] Co_Sumingit_Tsai_Project_Main.cpp" where [FileName] is any name you want to give the executable file.
5. run the generated exe file with "./[FileName] < [sample input file name].txt".
6. output will be generated as "testOutput.txt"
